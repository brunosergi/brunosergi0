I'm passionate about trying to understand how computer systems work and how we can use the hacker mindset to break their logic.
With persistence and a lot of "tryharder" I have been developing myself in the cybersecurity sector and improving my ethical hacking skills.

*"Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not surpass. Nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not overcome. Unrecognized geniuses is practically a cliche. Education will not exceed. The world is full of educated fools. Persistence and determination alone are powerful."*
